Welcome to my blog my friend

# Yo, yo! Welcome 

Welcome to my blog. My name is Michal and I'm a web developer. In this blog I'll be recording process of development **Smacker** - recipe management app. I decided to create a web app 
to develop my java and angular skills. I'm a web developer and I'm using both technologies everyday in work and want to go further in this direction. I chose recipe management app as I like to cook occasionally and very often I forget where I took a recipe from :smile:

Also together with my partner we have a scratch card of fun activities to do. Amongst them there's one called `Create a family cookbook` but in order to complete this one  
we need some place to record all the recipes :book:  

## Stack
For this project I'm using:
 - Spring Boot
 - Postgres
 - Angular v18

For hosting I'm currently using Raspberry PI 4 Model B - there's a running [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) instance serverd by [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) app. Any changes to the database are made using [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.com/).

UI is served using [Angular](https://angular.dev/) on my local machine

## Features

There's no plan yet for final version of the **Smacker** as requirements / expectations evolve during development :smile: For sure it should allow user to create a recipe, choose ingredients and tools needed for recipe and write down list of steps to execute the recipe. It should allow user to post photos of recipe and / or ingredients, tools etc. I also want it to calculate calories for recipes as this is often the most boring part of the recipe yes very important as I like to eat and if I don't track calories my belly is growing rapidly :bear:

After reading **[Making progress on side projects with content-driven development](https://www.ntietz.com/blog/making-progress-with-content-driven-development/)** I decided to create some simple blog for posting progress. Maybe someone will read that by a chance, maybe I will share it with someone, I'm not sure yet. For now it's for me only, I mean, it's still public but I'm not announcing it anywhere. Who know what happens next :calendar: For now I plan to create new posts when some progress is made. 

Stay tuned :wave:
